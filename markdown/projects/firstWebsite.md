description: "This was the first website I created from scratch, intended to function as a portfolio. It is made with HTML and CSS, and uses the Bootstrap CSS library for navigation. It features a thoughtful colourscheme, and careful aesthetic choices. The design elements were built by me, and have been reused in the current website."
