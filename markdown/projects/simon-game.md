This is my first attempt at building a web app with javascript, and makes use of the jquery library. It was also built as part of an Udemy course. I was given a specification and sound assets, but the code implementation is my work.

It is a fun, simple game to play. It has some features I would probably change in retrospect - most notably, it requires a keyboard input to start (making it unplayable on phones), and there is no way to turn off the sounds. Nevertheless, I believe it is a solid implementation of the simon game.
