description: "This was the rebuild of my original portfolio site, using Gatsby. While featuring a similar appearance to my first portfolio, it had revamped visuals for a more professional style. It has a responsive design and some simple animations made with the GSAP framework. The portfolio section is dynamically built from markdown files, allowing for easy maintenance."
