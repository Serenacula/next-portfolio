description: "This site was built as part of an internship with the Preverbal art studio. It was my first website built with React and Gatsby. Although only a single page, the site features interactive elements, responsive design, and basic animation. It builds the projects section from markdown files, and is designed for easy maintainability."

Preverbal is an art studio which I did an intership with, run by my older brother. The goal of the intership was to complete a website for the studio, according to a specification. Implementation details were up to me. My personal goal during the intership was to learn to use modern web technologies. While I had a more experienced coder providing guidance and feedback, my actual learning was completely self-taught.

The website is built using React, with the Gatsby framework. Since the site did not require any dynamic components, Gatsby was decided on in order to provide a static build, while still allowing for the convenience of modern web technologies.

In order to allow for easy maintenance in the future, it is designed to build from a list of markdown files, each of which represents a project done by the studio. This means that the maintainer only needs to add a new markdown file, and the website will automatically update itself.

After having spent so much time learning the fundamental web technologies, React was an incredibly fun experience to learn. I still find it a very enjoyable framework to use, and it has become my primary toolset for building.

Due to it being for a professional usecase, the source code is unfortunately not available.
