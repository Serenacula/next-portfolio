description: "This was the first website I created from scratch, intended to function as a portfolio. It is made with HTML and CSS, and uses the Bootstrap CSS library for navigation. It features a thoughtful colourscheme, and careful aesthetic choices. The design elements were built by me, and have been reused in the current website."

This was the first website I built from scratch, using pure HTML and CSS. There is limited bootstrap used, to provide the navbar functionality. It has no responsive design at all, making it difficult to view on a mobile phone.

The technical goal of the site when building was to create a functional portfolio website, though it was never intended to actually be used as such. I built this site initially to familiarise myself with the basic web technologies, as part of an Udemy course on web design. While the original project was quite simple, I decided to fully explore the tools available to me, and make something more individualised.

The colourscheme was carefully selected for a light-hearted feel. Deeper colours are used further down, to create a feeling similar to diving underwater. The text colours are individually chosen for each section to have contrast and legibility, while still fitting within the overall colourscheme.

While this site is no longer in use, I felt happy with the overall visual design, and it has remained in place in my current portfolio.
