A yellow-black theme made for the note-taking app Notable. It is written in CSS, and was designed to work in both dark and light modes.

It is one of the more popular themes of the app.

I've also written a [separate addon](https://github.com/Serenacula/notable-new-note-button), which adds a button to make new notes more easily.
