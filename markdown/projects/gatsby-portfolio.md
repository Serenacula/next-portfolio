description: "This was the rebuild of my original portfolio site, using Gatsby. While featuring a similar appearance to my first portfolio, it had revamped visuals for a more professional style. It has a responsive design and some simple animations made with the GSAP framework. The portfolio section is dynamically built from markdown files, allowing for easy maintenance."

After my internship with Preverbal, I decided to test my knowledge and skills with React and Gatsby by rebuilding my portfolio. Unlike the original HTML version, this one was intended for professional use. As such, the visuals were upgraded for a more chic, modern look.

Using some of the techniques I learnt when building Preverbal's website, I built this site with easy-maintenance in mind. In the portfolio section, it builds each portfolio from a markdown file, which give all the necessary information.

It also features some lightweight custom animations for the navbar, using the GSAP framework. They are subtle, but provided the interactivity I felt necessary, and allowed me to avoid using prebuilt CSS like Bootstrap.
