description: "This was an artist's portfolio website I built. It was created entirely in HTML and CSS, and made use of the Bootstrap CSS library. It was also my first attempt at responsive design, though it failed in several areas where I have since improved."

Originally built for my sister, this website is the first major project I completed for someone else. My sister required an online portfolio for a artists' studio interview. It was built to a rough design specification, though I had free reign for the specifics of the design. It uses pure HTML and CSS, along with the Bootstrap library. While the technology was basic, I attempted to give it a modern aesthetic, and to provide basic responsive design.

This was my first website to feature responsive design. While the responsive design was workable, it had some inconsistencies due to a misapplication of the Bootstrap's boilerplate code. These became difficult to fix when they later came to light, due to the CSS being built around them. Since building this site, I have taken more care to keep responsive design constantly in mind when developing.

The site was successful for the task it was built to achieve, and my sister succeeded at her studio interview. It has since been retired in favour of a Squarespace website, due to the difficulty of maintenance and keeping it updated.
