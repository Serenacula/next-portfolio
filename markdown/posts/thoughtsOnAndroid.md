#My Thoughts on Android, Coming from iOS

I just recently moved my phone over from iOS to Android. I have some thoughts.

Let’s... start with the process itself. It is not pleasant, moving from iOS to Android, not at all. Calendars and contacts were both an absolute nightmare to move over. Whatsapp, in a show of stunning laziness from Facebook, was completely impossible. These are systems that I would have expected to conform to some sort of standard across devices. Apparently not.

Contacts first. All of my contacts are in Apple’s system. The possibility of having multiple, inconsistent sets of contacts is a nightmare that I wish to avoid at all costs - this means that I needed my contacts to be able to sync between the two platforms. I still use a Macbook and iPad, so this made sense to me. 

You cannot, unfortunately, just ‘add’ your apple account to Android and expect it all to work though. I think this is a mistake on Google’s part, since I very nearly gave up just from frustration of this process, and plodded back to Apple’s walled garden, but I did persevere in the end.

The solution was a third party app, from the appstore. It will spoof your apple account’s contacts for you. They super promise they aren’t selling that data off on the side, on their ad-supported app that is never opened. Maybe they’re telling the truth, who knows. I do wish I didn’t have to take their word for it, and jeopardise my privacy and those of everyone I know, though. Thanks Google.

Contacts was the good case. I did, in fact, manage to get it to sync, even if I dislike the process. My calendar was a lost cause. The best I could realistically manage was to manually export it, and then import it into my google calednar. Or something. Maybe there is another third party app for this, but I must admit, I gave up on it at this point and just wiped the slate clean.

I know it is not impossible to have my calendar sync, since my windows desktop pulls from my apple calendar. Microsoft can do it Google, why not you?

Anyway. I could talk about my fury with WhatsApp, and the fact that I’m suffering from the exact same problems it had 7 years ago. Problems that Facebook has not bothered to devote a single engineer into spending a few weeks fixing. But no, I will leave it.

Instead, I want to talk about my first impressions of Android. Bear in mind I’m using OnePlus’s OxygenOS. I don’t know how much it differs from other versions of the platform, but I wanted to give a little context for this.

Android is... Surprisingly nice. Last time I used it, it was still kinda gross and janky. It has definitely become more beautiful in the intervening years.

The biggest draw is icon packs. My god, the ability to truly change my homescreen to make it actually look nice is wonderful. My iPhone’s homescreen did not look nice. It has never looked nice, with a clashing mishmash of company logos, and text underneath every single one. iOS is a recipe for sensory overload.

Android is not. Android’s homescreen is honestly it’s outstanding highlight feature. I can make it *pretty*, make my icons something tasteful and elegant that matches the background, get rid of the ugly-as-sin text labels cluttering up the place. I can, in short, make it mine.

You can’t do this with iOS. Every time I open my apple phone, I feel a little bit sad inside. For a company that prides itself on aesthetics, it is a goddamn travesty that Apple has not bothered to let people be even the slightest bit creative with something as personal as their phone. That little bit of sad is, in itself, what made me switch in the first place. My phone is mine, it should *feel* like mine.

So yeah. Get your shit together Apple, your phones look like garbage.

Unfortunately, it is not all sunshine and daisies in android-land. Yes, it wins the homescreen. But in most other areas of interface, it doesn’t do nearly as well. In fact, I’d even say it loses to Apple in a lot of areas.

The first big one is the travesty of Google’s bloatware. Swipe to the left of the homescreen, and you’re greeted with an absolute *barrage* of news, adverts, whatever Google wants to throw at you. It is a disaster. It is ugly and awful and I hate it.

It *can* be turned off, technically. I did, eventually work out how to do that on my journey through every single setting on this device (and let me tell you, the maze of poorly organised settings leaves something to be desired). But the fact that I had to put in such work to turn off something which is so obviously bad is mind boggling. This feature should not exist.

Do you know what Apple has, to the left of the homescreen? A few widgets. That’s right, something simple yet useful, that I would use to tell my headphone’s battery time, and check the weather. Not a lot, but it was a thoughtful feature that I could make use of. Google gives you an avalanche of bullshit you don’t want.

OnePlus has a separate feature they call Shelf, which is obviously an attempt to mimic the Apple widgets area. But it is not nearly so neat and natural, requiring you to memorise a special gesture, or manually assign it to one of the home buttons at the bottom of the screen. It’s not something you can just instinctively swipe to check, and that limits its practical usefulness, unless you’re the type to quickly memorise shortcuts.

I turned google’s puke feature off. I do not miss it. I wish it didn’t take up such a useful space in the Android system though.

Let’s talk about the next big failing of Android - bloatware.

I have a bunch of apps on my phone that cannot be deleted. One of those is Netflix. *Two* of them are file system apps, by separate companies. A whole bunch are stuff from Google, some of which seem like vital functions (GPay), some of which are pushing that boundary (why exactly do I have two youtube apps?) and some of which are obviously bullshit (looking at you, Google One, app with no identifiable useful purpose).

The point is, this bloatware is godawful. I never had to deal with nonsense like this on Apple - hell, I could delete the Music app, and everything was just fine. The apps I couldn’t delete, it made *sense* why I couldn’t delete them, for the most part.

Normally this would have been a huge issue for me. Luckily, however, OnePlus added a lovely feature designed to deal with precisely this - a vault to hide apps in you don’t want to see normally.

This is great. Yes, *technically* these apps are still present on my phone, but effectively they are not. They don’t pop up in searches, they’re not in the big ol’ list of apps, and I can easily pretend they never existed in the first place.

Good job, OnePlus. Woulda preferred you to just, ya know, not add the bloatware in the first place, but I guess everyone needs to pay the bills, so this is definitely better than nothing.

Still, the other side of this coin is that while my phone has a bunch of apps I don’t want or need, it also seems to be missing quite a few you would normally consider essential? There is no calculator app, for instance. Nor a QR reader. No media player.

It is weird. I think even my oldest dumbphone had a media player and a calculator, basic though it was. It isn’t a *big* issue, since I could just add them from the Play Store, but it did feel like a strange decision.

Let’s talk about the Android ecosystem a little bit. In some ways, it is still suffering from the same issues it had many years ago - an ecosystem built on advertising.

Most of the major apps are free. This is a big shift from the Apple ecosystem, where even a flashlight app probably costs at least a pound.

The alternative cost is that every single app on Android seems to include ads. I understand why this is, and why it is difficult to change - if people are used to being able to try out things and then just pay to take the ads off, they are unlikely to be willing to take a leap of faith and buy an app without trying it.

Still, it does give the platform a slightly gross feeling. Ads have a relationship so closely intermingled with data harvesting and selling, that it is sometimes difficult to tell the two apart, and I have no doubt that many of these apps are selling my data in the background.

The other side-effect of an ecosystem unused to paying for apps is, well... frankly, the quality of those apps. On iOS I used an app called Overcast for my podcasts. A fantastic app that did everything pretty much exactly as it should. Sure there’s a couple of things I’d change, but that is true of any app. It is as close as I have come to a perfect podcast app.

There is no Overcast on Android. There are quite a number of other podcasting apps but none of them... quite hit the mark. The level of quality is just not as high.

It is not world-ending. It is certainly not a new issue, I remember facing the same one years ago. But it is a shame, that the ecosystem hasn’t managed to overcome this particular challenge in the intervening years.

Finally, let’s talk about the experience of actively using these platforms.

On the face of it, I’d say that Android seems to win this - it gives you *far* more options for how you want to shape your experience of using this phone. Giving choices to its customers seems to be something Apple is nearly allergic to.

The problem is that a lot of these options are just ways to try and minimise the absolute bullshit Google has shoved into this experience. Yes, I spent a whole day setting up and customising my phone, but *most* of those choices were just getting it into a usable state. Only a small section of it was on the genuinely fun stuff.

There are also important areas where Android totally fails. By default, every app has complete notification permissions. And if that wasn’t already bad enough, *there is no list of notification permissions*. You can’t just go down a list and remove all the notifications, you have to wait for each app to irritate you, then manually change it at that moment.

I hate this. For all its problems, iOS’s notifications system is worlds better than this. I can set exactly which app can notify my in what ways. Android has no equivalent to this that I can find.

It’s not all bad. There is stuff where Android genuinely seems to have put in the work to give their users interesting choices that Apple wouldn’t dream of doing. For example I can add gestures, if I want, to open a particular app. I also have a lot of control over what the lockscreen looks like, and how it interacts. I can get emails on my homescreen, which for some reason I can’t with iOS.

So - Okay, to step back for a moment here, I just want to point this out as something genuinely weird about Android. There are *some areas* where it is obvious that a huge degree of love and attention has gone into it. It was really thoughtful of them to add in a gesture system. It is something they didn’t have to do, nobody would have noticed if it was missing, and yet somebody put a lot of thought and care into making it nice and useful.

The fact that you can change to the old android navigation system, with a back button, is another example of this. It’s not perfect, and I do wish they add they ability to swipe *and* have a back button, but it’s still really nice of them to give users that choice.

And then there is the other stuff. The stuff that is just gross. Why does Google feel the need to puke news onto my homescreen? Hell if I know, it is obviously a godawful user experience, and yet still sits on prime real estate. And why do I have to waste my time spending several bloody hours, trying to disable all of the tracking options on this device?

Android, in this sense, feels like a system of extremes. It loves me and it hates me. By contrast, iOS was a system almost completely indifferent to its user, much more refined, yet at the expense of caring about you at all. iOS is a narcissist, Android is capricious. I guess both could end up equalling out, in theory.

In practice, though? iOS wins. For general navigation and usage, it's just plain nicer. You notice negative experiences, unlike the positives. A device's UI should be unnoticable, and Apple achieves that.

Although, maybe I'm a bit biased here. This could be an effect of just recently changing phones, coming to haunt me. I'm willing to give Android the benefit of the doubt for a bit longer.

Android... has nice phones. They’re invariably ugly phones, to be sure, for some reason only Apple seems to know how to make a genuinely good looking phone. But they are *nice* phones.

My Android phone cost me £450. For that I have a really gorgeous big 120Hz display, faceID, under-screen touchID, 256GB of storage, and a decent-ish camera. I couldn’t get an iphone with those specs for twice that price. There is not, in fact, *any* iPhone capable of all of those features.

I’m not a fan of hardware comparisons. To be honest, I don’t actually think hardware matters nearly as much as people claim, for a daily user. If you’re a big camera user, then maybe that is something to pay attention to, but Apple dominates on that front anyways, so whatever. Most phones are good enough.

The fact that Apple haven’t managed an under-screen touchID does drive me a bit nuts though. In a world of masks faceID is basically useless, and typing in your code on a modern phone with a single hand is a pain in the fucking neck, because they’re all the size of a small tablet. iPhones should have a fingerprint sensor. There is really no excuse for this.

Apple gets beauty. Android gets good hardware and good value. It should be an easy win.

Unfortunately, this coin has another side.

Yes, my android phone is much cheaper. My iPhone lasts much *longer*. My old phone was an iPhone 6S, old tech even when I bought it 5 years ago. And yet, it is still supported by Apple, and gets software updates to this day. In most ways, it is pretty much equivalent to a modern iPhone, except for the size and lack of a full-front display.

Android phones, from what I have read, seem to have a shelf life of 2, maybe 3 years. That is really bad. I don’t understand how a manufacturer can even get *away* with dropping support like that. It’s not like the phone will suddenly stop working, right? If there is nothing physically wrong with the device, why should you stop pushing updates to it?

We’re not even just talking about feature upgrades here, we’re talking about *basic security fixes*. This is real important, core stuff getting dropped in favour of selling you a new piece of glass.

Android phones could have a real advantage here. Instead, they shoot themselves in the foot and give it away to Apple.

My overall impressions? Mmm.... mixed.

In most categories, iOS was generally the winner. It was nicer to use, sensible defaults, and for the most part felt like it was on your side. Android does not feel like it is on your side, it feels like a pushy car salesman, trying to blackmail you with technicalities.

But.

There is a but.

iOS’s customisability is just not good. In fact, it was bad enough to make me feel *actively sad* to have to interact with the homescreen. It shouldn’t feel like that.

This isn’t just a result of Apple not trusting its users, which is true of every company, it’s more than that. It is an unwillingness to let them make aesthetic choices. My iPhone was ugly, and I hated that. Something I spend so much time with shouldn’t be ugly, it should be pretty and it should make me feel nice.

People come up with weird, hacky solutions to try and work around this issue, like using Apple’s shortcuts system to create an alternative icon, but these come with their own drawback of making the system feel awful to use.

I know Apple is currently working on letting people customise their homescreen. It should have been done 5 years ago, but fine. Yay, we have widgets, great. I want to change my icons, Apple. I want to be able to get rid of the text underneath every logo (I ask you, what is even the point of a logo if it needs text under it anyways?).

I want my phone to not make me sad. Until they manage this, I’ll be trying out my shiny new Android phone.
