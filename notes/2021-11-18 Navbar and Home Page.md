# Navbar and Homepage

Today's task is to finish up with the navbar, for the moment. I've cleaned it up so that it's now working properly. 

Next, I want to get the homepage looking nice again. I'm also planning to change up the shit 'about' bit to not look so bad. Maybe a card would look nicer, or I could just get rid of it, idk.

I've also got to get some job applications done today. I've got a benefits meeting at 4PM.
